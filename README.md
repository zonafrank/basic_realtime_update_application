# basic_realtime_update_application

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the real-time chat application, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**:

   - **Version**: v12 or higher
   - **Installation**: Download and install Node.js from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which you will use to install the project's dependencies.

2. **npm (Node Package Manager)**:

   - **Version**: Comes bundled with Node.js. Ensure it is up to date by running `npm install -g npm` in your terminal after installing Node.js.
   - **Usage**: npm is used to manage the project's dependencies and run various scripts to build and start the application.

3. **Git**:
   - **Version**: Any recent version
   - **Installation**: Download and install Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is used to clone the project repository from GitHub.
   - **Usage**: Git enables you to clone the repository and manage version control for the project.

### Verifying Installations

To verify that you have these prerequisites installed correctly, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Node.js**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

This should output the version of Node.js installed on your machine (v12 or higher).

2. npm:

```bash
    npm -v
```

This should output the version of npm installed on your machine.

3. Git:

```bash
   git --version
```

This should output the version of Git installed on your machine.

By ensuring these prerequisites are installed, you will be prepared to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the real-time chat application.
